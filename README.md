Detection of plant disease from images.
Created by: Kyle T. Peterson

*This project is currently still under the final development stages.

Based on the initial framework provided by: 
[1] Akhtar, Asma, et al. "Automated Plant Disease Analysis (APDA): Performance Comparison of Machine Learning Techniques." Frontiers of Information Technology (FIT), 2013 11th International Conference on. IEEE, 2013. 
[2] Multiclass SVM by Anand Mishra link: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33170-multi-class-support-vector-machine 

GUI based on Manu B.N's implementation of the disease detection papers [1,2]. 

This application allows a user to select an image from file and determine the the disease present in the leaf.
